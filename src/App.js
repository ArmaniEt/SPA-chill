// We have to have at least 3 components.
// Create a main page with own layout. It will be in containers dir.
// Try to use NavLink (read documentation).
// Additionally components with layout to go to (I suppose it also will be in containers dir with own state each).
// Also import BrowserRouter in App.js with other React Router components.
